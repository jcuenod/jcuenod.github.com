# James Cuénod

Welcome to my portfolio website. My name is [James Cuénod](about/) and you can find more about me here (or find out how to find out more about me here). I hope to direct you to information about my two basic interests: *biblical studies* (especially the Old Testament) and *software development*.

Currently I am a PhD student at Wheaton College studying **Old Testament** where I intend to write about **Sabbath Theology**. To find out more about my work in the biblical studies arena, take a look [here](biblical/).

I do an embarrassing amount of hobbyist programming - embarrassing because, given the quantity one would expect the quality to be somewhat superior. Nevertheless, if you are interested in that you can see more about my software adventures [here](software/). I tend to do a lot of development at the intersection between my discipline of biblical studies my interest in using computers to make that work better/easier so I guess it's a kind of digital humanities but certainly counts as the **intersection between bible and technology**.
